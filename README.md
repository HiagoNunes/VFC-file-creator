Do you need to add a lot of contacts all at once to your phone or similar devices? How about a script that simplifies the creation of a .vcf (virtual card format) file through Google Sheets?

Spreadsheet for Saving Contacts to a VCF (Virtual Card Format) File

The VCF file is a type of contact file. It's useful for saving multiple contacts all at once on your phone or email, for example.

How to Use:
1. Enter all the contacts you want to add in the "Contacts" spreadsheet (if there are already contacts in the spreadsheet, delete the old contacts and keep only the ones you're interested in).
2. To ensure the contact is correctly recognized in WhatsApp, it's important that the phone number follows the format in the example: +55 (81) 99999-9999.
3. Click the "Save Contacts to VCF File" button available in the Contacts tab.
4. Enter your email address to receive the created VCF file and click OK.
5. After the script finishes, check if you've been shared a file named "contacts.vcf."
6. Download the file (important: with each new creation of the VCF file, the old one is deleted, so it's important to download it).

To save all the contacts on your phone (to view in WhatsApp, for example):
7. Open the contacts.vcf file on your phone and wait for all the contacts to update.
